Business Administrator, Finance Specialist, with focus on Data Science at the specialized HENRY Bootcamp.

I possess strategic skills when it comes to interpreting and presenting results and data at the organizational level, stemming from over 10 years of experience in financial and administrative areas, now enhanced by proficiency in tools such as Python, MySQL, PowerBi, Power Query, and Big Data environments. This proficiency allows me to make rational, objective, and effective decisions.

I am committed to achieving results, formulating solutions in line with the organization's objectives with a focus on continuous improvement. I actively contribute to the development of new ideas that enable the organization to increase its value and meet the needs of clients and stakeholders responsibly, professionally, and in a humane, respectful manner, all while emphasizing service and teamwork.
